# Final Project - Part 2

This portion of the project combines the NY Open Data Crime Dataset with the American Community Survey (ACS) demographic dataset.  Specifically,  we used the PUMA generated Neighborhood Tabulaton Area (NTA) data.  The American Community Survey (ACS) which is program run by the U.S. Cenus Bureau that collects continuing statistical data about American's population, housing, and workforce data.  In our project, we focus on the ACS data for the New York area.


## 1- Generate the Demographic Data
In this section, we normalize the ACS dataset and generate the new output into "ce_{filname}.csv" files.  These new output files are used to find interesting elements of the NY Crime Dataset.


1) General Informaton:
    1) Location:  part2-code/create_population_data
    2) The Demographic_intermediary_csv.zip file is originally generated from the Demographics_20and_20profiles_20at_20the_20Neighborhood_20Tabulation_20Area_20_NTA__20level.zip file. 
        * ACS Dataset Link:  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Social-Economic-and-Housing-Profiles-b/kvuc-fg9b
        * Save each xls file as a "Windows Comman Separated (.csv)"
     

2. Run Command: 
```
cd create_demographic_data
unzip Demographic_intermediary_csv.zip
```

## 2- Add the Neighborhood Tabulation Area Dataset to the NY Crime Dataset
In this section, each crime record is matched to its neighborhood NTACode and NTADescription (ex:  BK72, Williamsburg), then appended to the crime file.  There are two options to generate this data;  either a Spark or Standalone job can be run.  



Option 1) 
Run as Standalone - when we first tried this, we tried to create a Spark job running on an Amazon EMR cluster.  The Spark job was successful when run on small test datasets of the crime data,  however stalled on larger datasets even though optimizations to the Spark job had been added.  Running the Standalone turned out to be the better and quicker option for us.  
```
cd create_crime_data

```

Option 2) 
Run on Spark - this was too slow even when run on our Amazon EMR cluster even after optimizing our code!  So, eventually we converted the Spark job to a standalone job.
```
cd create_crime_data

```


Thanks!
