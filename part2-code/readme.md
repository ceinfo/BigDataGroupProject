# Final Project - Part 2

This portion of the project combines the NY Open Data Crime Dataset with the American Community Survey (ACS) population dataset.  Specifically,  we used the PUMA generated Neighborhood Tabulaton Area (NTA) data.  The American Community Survey (ACS) which is program run by the U.S. Cenus Bureau that collects continuing statistical data about American's population, housing, and workforce data.  In our project, we focus on the ACS data for the New York area.


## 1- Generate the Population Data
In this section, we normalize the ACS dataset and generate the new output into "ce_{filname}" files.  These new output files are used to find interesting elements of the NY Crime Dataset.  
```
cd create_population_data
unzip Demographic_intermediary_csv.zip

```

## 2- Add the Neighborhood Tabulation Area Dataset to the NY Crime Dataset
In this section, we normalize the ACS dataset and generate the new output into "ce_{filname}" files.  These new output files are used to find interesting elements of the NY Crime Dataset.  
```
cd create_crime_data


```
