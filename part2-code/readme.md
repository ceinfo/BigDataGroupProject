# Final Project - Part 2

This portion of the project combines the NY Open Data Crime Dataset with the American Community Survey (ACS) demographic Dataset.  Specifically,  we used the PUMA generated Neighborhood Tabulaton Area (NTA) data.  The American Community Survey (ACS) is a U.S. Cenus Bureau program that continually collects statistical data about the American population, housing, and workforce.  In our project, we focus on using the ACS data for the New York area.


## 1- Generate the Demographic Data
In this section, we normalize the ACS dataset and generate the new output into "ce_{filname}.csv" files.  These new output files are used to find interesting elements of the NY Crime Dataset.


**1) General Information:**
```
1) Location:  part2-code/create_demographic_data
2) The Demographic_intermediary_csv.zip file is originally generated from the                
   Demographics_20and_20profiles_20at_20the_20Neighborhood_20Tabulation_20Area_20_NTA__20level.zip file. 
     * ACS Dataset Link:  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Demographic-Social-Economic-and-Housing-Profiles-b/kvuc-fg9b 
     * Save each xls file as a "Windows Comma Separated (.csv)"
3) See sample output files in:  create_demographic_data/cleaned_acs

```     

**2) Run Command:**

## 2- Add the Neighborhood Tabulation Area Dataset to the NY Crime Dataset
In this section, each crime record is matched to its neighborhood NTACode and NTADescription (ex:  BK72, Williamsburg).  Next, these values are appended to the crime file.  There are two options to generate this data;  either a Spark or Standalone job can be run.  


**1) General Information:**

     1) Location:  part2-code/create_crime_data
     2) The NTAmap.geojson located in our repository contains the NYC Neighborhood Tabulation Areas.   
       - NTA Link:  https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/NTA-map/d3qk-pfyz/data 
       - Download as "GEOJSON"


**2) Run Command:**

   **Option 1) Run as Standalone**

   When we first tried this, we created a Spark job running on an Amazon EMR cluster.  The Spark job was successful when run on small test datasets of the crime data,  however stalled (ex: still running after 40 mins with no data produced) on larger datasets even after optimizations to the Spark job had been added.  Running the Standalone turned out to be the better and quicker option for us.  

   Note:  A small sample of the NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv has been uploaded in create_crime_data/ny.csv.  This can replace the NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv below in the commands if a quick test is desired. 
```
cd create_crime_data
pip install shapely
cat NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv | python ./gencrime_alt.py NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv   #Can replace csv with ny.csv

```

**Option 2) Run on Spark**

This was too slow even when run on our Amazon EMR cluster even after optimizing our code!  So, eventually we converted the Spark job to a standalone job.
```
cd create_crime_data
pip install shapely
hadoop fs -copyFromLocal NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv    #Can replace csv with ny.csv
spark-submit gencrime.py NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv    #Can replace csv with ny.csv

```
